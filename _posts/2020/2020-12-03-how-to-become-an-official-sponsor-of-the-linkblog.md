UPDATE (2020-12-20) - This blog post has been turned into a separate page, check out the [sponsorships]({{ site.baseurl }}/sponsorships) page for the latest.

It’s now possible to become an official sponsor of the linkblog!

I’ve spent time working for [feature film visual effects companies]({{ site.baseurl }}/2020/11/24/what-its-like-working-in-tech-in-the-visual-effects-industry.html) and an [enterprise software startup]({{ site.baseurl }}/2020/11/30/what-its-like-working-for-an-enterprise-software-startup.html), and I’ve been running the linkblog for [close to 10 years](https://links.markjgsmith.com/archives/html). It's one of the longest running personal linkblogs on the internet.

The readership is very tech and developer focussed, lots of smart people working for big tech related companies. 

**What do you get as a sponsor?**

{:refdef: style="list-style-type:disc; margin-bottom: 14px;"}
- Your logo displayed on each linkblog day that you sponsor
- A special blog post at the end of the week thanking you and linking to your website (for 7 day sponsorships)
- A special mention in the newsletter that gets sent out on Saturday (for 7 day sponsorships)
{: refdef}

The logo is right under all the links for the day, grouped with the patreon button.

It will appear on the main linkblog page which displays the most recent 50 days. It will also live on in the day and month archive pages.

Here’s an example of what it would look like for the [month](https://links.markjgsmith.com/archives/html/2020/12) and [day](https://links.markjgsmith.com/archives/html/2020/12/03) archive pages. It will look very similar on the [main linkblog page](https://links.markjgsmith.com)

If you’d like to become a sponsor then get in touch with me [via email](mailto:markjgsmith@gmail.com).
