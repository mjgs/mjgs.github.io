This is a bit of an aggregation piece, pulling together several thematically related posts that I think work quite well together to inform on the topic of choosing your web development stack. I’m a NodeJS developer so that’s my focus, but even if you are using a different language, a lot of the information might be useful in terms of building a broader understanding of the web development landscape.
