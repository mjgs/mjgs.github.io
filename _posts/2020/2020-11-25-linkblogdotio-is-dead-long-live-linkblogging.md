title: Linkblog.io is dead, long live linkblogging
description: It's never easy announcing the end of a project, especially one you've spent a considerable amount of time working on. That's what this post is about, but it's also about a new beginning with some exciting new announcements

Linkblog.io the minimalist link curation tool, the Saas I spent 3 years building, is no longer live. All active users have been contacted and I’ve decommissioned the site.

Though the site was a tremendous success in terms of meeting my personal learning and development goals, building a robust SaaS from soup to nuts, ultimately I didn’t get the traction as far as user base that I had hoped for. Continuing to maintain the site didn’t make sense because it wasn’t generating any income.

**[I’m still linkblogging!](https://links.markjgsmith.com)**

I’ve been experimenting with [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org), [Serverless](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serverless_computing) and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) and have built a prototype linkblog static site generator that I’m using every day. It builds [10 years of content](https://links.markjgsmith.com/archives/html) in just a few seconds. It’s totally serverless. It’s pretty sweet.

I’ve been blown away with the possibilities that the jamstack opens up for [creating custom content workflows](https://blog.markjgsmith.com/2020/10/30/github-actions-for-custom-content-workflows.html). 

I’ve also started a **[weekly newsletter](https://markjgsmith.substack.com)** where I share the best posts from the linkblog.

The general theme is javascript / tech / web development, but I also blend in some other topics from time to time.

I hope you like it, [consider subscribing](https://markjgsmith.substack.com), it's completely free!

All the best.
