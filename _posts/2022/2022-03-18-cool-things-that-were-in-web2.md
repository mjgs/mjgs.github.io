Last week I listened to a [John Gruber interview with Tom Watson and Daniel Agee](https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2022/03/09/ep-340), the founders of the photo sharing app [Glass](https://glass.photo). They talked a lot about what it was like during web2.0, including some of the cool things that got developed in that period. 

I enjoyed the brief trip down memory lane, an oasis of calm amongst the current madness all around. I spent a few minutes making a list of sim of the things I remember, and enjoyed wondering how some of these types of technologies and trends could blend with things in web3.0.

Hereâ€™s that list:

- Rocketboom, Ze Frank, and videoblogging
- Citizen journalism
- Creative Commons licensing
- Crowd funding 
- Community events and meet-ups
- The Maker movement
- 3D printing
- Photo sharing
- Video streaming
- Blogging and RSS
- Live photo feeds from events with photos displaying on your desktop as they are taken
- Journalism integrated with data analysis tools
- Social media 
- Newsrooms integrating social media into their broadcasts
- Wikipedia 
- APIs everywhere
- Web services - AWS, Azure etc
- Podcasting and podcast tools
- Open source hardware
- Open source software
- Github repos and actions
- Bit torrent for sharing assets with listeners to collaborate on
- User Generated Content

Some of these were around before web2.0, but got very popular during web2.0 and arguably some were developed more recently but IMO feel very web2ish. Nonetheless when I think about web2.0, these are some of the things that come to mind.
