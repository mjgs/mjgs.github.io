My brain: Do __this__ now or I will delete this…

Me: Yes that does sound interesting, I’ll just finish what I was doing first, it will only take a few seconds

My brain: Too late! this has been deleted, haha, that’ll learn you

Me: Shit, what was I doing again? :(

I think perhaps it happens more often when "the external world" is constantly butting in trying to prompt me todo things that I am already about to do. Eventually it devolves into some sort of race condition, and the only thing you can do is walk and move really really slowly like you are a grandad. 

Makes you wonder about alternative scenarios for where grandad’s actually come from, which doesn’t help the situation much either.
