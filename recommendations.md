It was a pretty hectic atmosphere, a lot of production pressure and tight deadlines but Mark was great at keeping it all together, working with the team and the artists - he was very dedicated to getting the job done. There was a lot of liaising with different departments: software/developers, production, 2d/3d artists - he's great at keeping everyone together and on the same page.
